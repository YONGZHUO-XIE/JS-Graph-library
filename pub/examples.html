          <strong class="title">Line Graph</strong><br />
          <p>
            A graph that uses lines to connect individual data points, it shows
            the fluctions of a set of data
          </p>
          <p>
            You can move your mouse point to the any data point on the line
            which will tell you the information of that particular data point.
            You can also add the new line segment into the graph by entering a
            new data array into the placeholder, the input will be seperate by
            comma, not space between them. (example will be:
            2222,3333,4444,5555,6666)

          <p>
            Uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables.
            Normally, it is a good representation of the distribuiton of the
            data
          </p>
          <p>
            You can enter a range from xMin to xMax, yMin to yMax and a color to
            paint all the points within that range. (example will be {x
            minimun:0, x maximum:1000, y minimum: 200, y mamimum: 400, color:
            blue}
